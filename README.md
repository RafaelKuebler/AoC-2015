# Advent of Code 2015

This repo contains my `Python 3.11` solutions for the [Advent of Code 2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015).

From the website:

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

## Running

The `run.py` files are supposed to be run from the repo root, e.g. like `python day1/run.py`.

Some handy commands can be run via `make`. See the [Makefile](Makefile).
