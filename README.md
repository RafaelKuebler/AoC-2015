# Advent of Code 2022

This repo contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

From the website:

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

## Running

The `run.py` files are supposed to be run from the repo root.

The solutions are all written in `Python 3.8`. Newer Python versions have been out, but I just happened to have this one installed at the time.
